It would be fair to expect a lul in the penultimate week of a 7 week course - not here though! At Founders and Coders, things are picking up. The skills weâ€™ve hacked together over our short time here are about ready for a field test. Seven days from now we begin paid web development. Time to clear ambiguities, plug holes and work out a decent testing protocal. We should (God help us) be ready.

You really can do a lot in a short space of time, with enough work and commitment.
