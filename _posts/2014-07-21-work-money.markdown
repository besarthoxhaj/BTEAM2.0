It would be fair to expect a lul in the penultimate week of a 7 week course but, if anything, I would say things are picking up. The skills weâ€™ve hacked together over our short time here, are close to being well rounded enough to start work on some serious, real world, projects. We are, in fact, hoping to begin work on paid web development, effective as of next week. Seven days to fill in a database/testing sized hole and we should be ready. It is incredible what you can do in a short space of time, with enough work and commitment.
