Founders and Coders has been the one of the most intense academic challenges of my life. If it wasn’t for the last few weeks of my degree, I would be completely unfamiliar with the volume of work we’ve managed to get through so far. This time around, however, the work is a lot more enjoyable. 

I enjoyed my degree. It was interesting, my coursemates were bright and motivated, my lecturers were, for the most part, very good. All of this and, shamefully, I probably averaged less 5h a day, 26 weeks a year. Also, a degree has a lot resting on it: It represents years of education, is a huge financial outlay and has serious implications for your future career. Founders and Coders has none of this. It is a free course, we do in our free time, for our immediate benefit. We could leave tomorrow and only lose what we didn’t already have. But we don’t leave. We work hard, 10h a day, plus weekends. And it’s fun. Actually fun! There is something incredibly powerful about working in groups. The work-place knows it, the army knows it, we know it in our day-to-day lives, when we get a gym buddy or join a book club. Somewhere along the line education has forgotten what we are: Social animals. Splitting us up is counterproductive. It doesn’t nurture the skills we need, nor help us when we need to work hard. Open ended, group based, projects are the way forward.
