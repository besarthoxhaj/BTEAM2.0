Barry has gone, long live Barry! Unfortunately, our friend Barry is leaving us. 
He will be missed! Although we are sad to be loosing him we can take comfort in the knowledge that Barry's positive attitude, hard work and calming influence has found a good home in the GLA, where he will be tackling the ever important issue of London air quality.

Barry has his dream job, the GLA have their best man; some things are meant to be.

Good luck Barry!
