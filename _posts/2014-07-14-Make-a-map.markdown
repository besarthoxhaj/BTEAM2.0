It's monday, and as every monday, a new challenge is waiting for us! This time came to visit us Robin Houston a real expert of data visualization, who has worked, amongst others, for the Guardian.
As usual the bar gets higher! We have until Friday afternoon to create an interactive world map showing the price of cocaine per country.

Robin's demonstration gave us some new business ideas. For sure, one of the most interesting came from the arbitrage opportunity between Colombia and Canada. Buying a kilo for 200$ and sell it for 20.000$ sounded a great deal for most of us!
